This file is generated only for your convenience during testing, so you know what your user password is, 
 without the need to copy it on creation from the console. 
 It plays no role in the application. In real-world your password shall be set by you and NEVER TO BE STORED by the application. 
 
 Therefore, the original passes were NOT saved to  operators.json, which is the file used by the app. 
 
  IT ONLY STORES HASHES!
